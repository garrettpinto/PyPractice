Name Mangling: Explore name mangling by creating a class with private attributes and methods.

Attribute Privacy: Create a class that demonstrates encapsulation and access control using private attributes.

Object Comparison Operations: Design a class to compare two dates and determine which one is chronologically earlier.

Advanced Exception Handling: Write a program that handles exceptions gracefully while parsing and processing user data.

Object Iteration: Implement a class that allows iterating over the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term.

Object Instantiation: Develop a class that represents a cooking recipe and includes methods for preparation.

Dataclasses and NamedTuples: Create a program using dataclasses or namedtuples to store and manage contact information.

Unit Testing and Packaging
Unit Testing: Write unit tests for a calculator application to ensure its arithmetic operations are accurate.

Building Packages: Create a package that contains utility functions for working with dates and times.

PIP Installable Packages: Publish your date/time utility package on the Python Package Index (PyPI).

Understanding Package Imports: Build a program that demonstrates importing functions from different modules within a package.

Absolute vs. Relative Imports: Experiment with importing modules using both absolute and relative import paths.

Circular References: Create two classes that reference each other and explore how circular references can be managed.

Argument Packing: Develop a function that accepts a variable number of arguments and returns their sum.

Defense
File Input/Output: Write a program that reads a text file, processes its contents, and writes the result to a new file.

Regular Expressions: Build a script that validates and sanitizes user input using regular expressions.

Log File Analysis: Analyze a log file and extract relevant information like error messages or timestamps.

Packet Analysis: Explore packet capture data and write a program to extract and analyze network packet information.

Forensics
